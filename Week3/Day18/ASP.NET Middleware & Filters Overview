Day 18: ASP.NET Middleware & Filters

1. Custom Middleware
Middleware in ASP.NET Core is software that's assembled into the application pipeline to handle requests and responses.
It can modify the request on the way in and the response on the way out.
Middleware components are executed in the order they are registered.

How to create custom middleware?
Create a class with a Invoke or InvokeAsync method.
Take HttpContext as a parameter.
Use the RequestDelegate to call the next middleware.
Register your middleware in the pipeline.

2. Exception Handling
Exception handling middleware is used to catch unhandled exceptions across the app in a centralized way.
ASP.NET Core provides built-in UseExceptionHandler middleware.
For development, you can use UseDeveloperExceptionPage for detailed error info.
Custom exception handling middleware can log the error or return custom responses.

3. Logging
Logging records information about application behavior.
ASP.NET Core provides built-in logging via ILogger<T>.
Logs can be written to Console, Debug, files, or external services.
Middleware and filters can utilize logging for diagnostics and audits.

Step-By-Step Process: Beginner to Expert

Beginner Level

1. Understand what middleware is and its role in the request pipeline.
Explanation:
Middleware in ASP.NET Core is software that sits between an incoming HTTP request and the final response, forming a pipeline where each middleware component can inspect, modify, or short-circuit the request or response. It can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

Use case:
When a web request comes in, middleware can authenticate the user before the request hits your controllers or write logs about the request.

2. Learn to create a simple middleware that logs every request.
Explanation:
This involves writing a class with an InvokeAsync(HttpContext) method that logs the request info (such as URL or HTTP method) and then calls the next middleware.

Use case:
Basic request logging to monitor traffic and analyze usage patterns.

3. Learn built-in middleware like UseStaticFiles, UseRouting, UseEndpoints.
Explanation of common built-in middleware:
UseStaticFiles: Serves static files like images, JavaScript, CSS from wwwroot folder.
UseRouting: Analyzes the request URL and selects the endpoint.
UseEndpoints: Executes the matched endpoint (e.g., MVC controllers, Razor Pages).
Use case:
Every web app typically needs to serve static files and route requests to controllers or pages. These middleware handle these tasks efficiently.

4. Learn basics of exception handling middleware (UseExceptionHandler).
Explanation:
This middleware catches any unhandled exceptions during request processing, preventing the app from crashing and providing a friendly error response.

Use case:
In production, you want a user-friendly error page instead of a stack trace showing on the browser.

5. Explore basic logging with the ILogger interface.
Explanation:
ILogger<T> is an abstraction for logging in ASP.NET Core, allowing you to write logs to various outputs (console, files, external services) without hard dependencies.

Use case:
You can log errors, warnings, and informational messages anywhere in your app—middleware, controllers, services.

Intermediate Level

6. Build custom middleware for specific functionalities (e.g., authentication, custom headers).
Explanation:
You can write middleware for cross-cutting concerns like validating tokens, adding security headers, or validating API keys.

Use case:
Adding a custom HTTP header to all responses for tracking or adding custom authentication logic.

7. Implement a centralized exception handling middleware with custom error responses.
Explanation:
Instead of default error pages, handle exceptions centrally to log errors and return JSON with structured error details, suitable for APIs.

Use case:
REST APIs often return JSON error messages rather than HTML error pages.

8. Use dependency injection to inject services into middleware.
Explanation:
Middleware constructors support DI, allowing you to inject logging, database, or other services into the middleware.

Use case:
Use a logging service or a database context inside your middleware to save diagnostics or check data.

9. Understand middleware ordering importance.
Explanation:
Middleware executes in the order registered. For example, exception handling middleware must wrap everything to catch all unhandled exceptions.

Use case:
If authentication middleware runs after your endpoints, unauthorized users might access sensitive data.

10. Configure logging providers and filters.
Explanation:
You can configure various logging providers (Console, Debug, File, Application Insights) and filter logs by log level or category.

Use case:
In production, you want only warnings and errors logged to conserve space; in development, log everything.

11. Explore action filters and their use in exception handling and logging.
Explanation:
Action filters are MVC-specific. They run before/after controller actions. They can log information or handle exceptions related only to action execution.

Use case:
You want to log only controller actions or modify responses globally for MVC without touching middleware.

Advanced Level
12. Create complex middleware chains with conditionals and branching.
Explanation:
Middleware can conditionally invoke next middleware or short-circuit. Complex pipelines can route requests differently based on conditions.

Use case:
Serve different versions of a site, or route API requests differently depending on the URL or request headers.

13. Implement structured logging and correlation IDs.
Explanation:
Structured logging uses key-value pairs, making logs searchable and easier to analyze. Correlation IDs tie all logs in a request.

Use case:
Trace a user request through multiple services to debug distributed systems.

14. Integrate logging with external systems (Seq, ELK stack, Application Insights).
Explanation:
Send logs to centralized platforms for aggregation, searching, dashboarding.

Use case:
Your production systems integrate logs into Kibana or Azure Monitor to track service health.

15. Use filters for cross-cutting concerns in MVC/Web API.
Explanation:
Use filters (authorization, exception, action, result filters) to handle concerns scoped to MVC actions.

Use case:
Add custom header validation for all API endpoints via an action filter.

16. Handle asynchronous middleware and exception flows.
Explanation:
Middleware must properly use async/await and handle exceptions inside async calls.

Use case:
Ensures no deadlocks or unhandled exceptions in async data access operations.

17. Profile and optimize middleware performance.
Explanation:
Use profiling tools to identify slow middleware and optimize or remove them.

Use case:
Improve API throughput by eliminating unnecessary logging or header checks.

18. Write unit and integration tests for middleware and filters.
Explanation:
Test middleware components in isolation ensuring they behave correctly.

Use case:
Verify that your authentication middleware returns 401 on invalid tokens without calling subsequent middleware.

Best Practices Explained
Ordering matters:
Middleware runs in order; put exception middleware early to catch all errors.

Avoid long blocking calls:
Use async calls to prevent thread blocking and improve scalability.

Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns:
Middleware should handle concerns that apply across the app, not just business logic.

Keep middleware simple and focused:
Each middleware should do one thing well—easy maintenance and testing.

Log enough context:
Include request paths, user identities, headers in logs for better debugging.

Return consistent error responses:
Clients expect consistent error formats, especially APIs.

Use dependency injection:
Makes middleware decoupled and easier to test.

Don’t expose sensitive exception details in production:
Log details internally but return safe generic messages to clients.

Use filters in MVC when handling action-related logic:
Use middleware for general HTTP pipeline concerns and filters for MVC-level concerns.

Sample Project Code: Middleware, Exception Handling, Logging
Setup
.NET 6/7/8  Web API Template.

Create Middleware, Exception Handling & Logging example.

Sample: Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  

// Add logging configuration (console by default)  
builder.Logging.ClearProviders();  
builder.Logging.AddConsole();  

var app = builder.Build();  

// Use custom exception handler middleware  
app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>();  

// Use custom logging middleware  
app.UseMiddleware<RequestLoggingMiddleware>();  

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");  

// Endpoint to test exception handling  
app.MapGet("/error", () =>  
{  
    throw new Exception("Test exception!");  
});  

app.Run();  

Custom Middleware: RequestLoggingMiddleware.cs

public class RequestLoggingMiddleware  
{  
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;  
    private readonly ILogger<RequestLoggingMiddleware> _logger;  

    public RequestLoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<RequestLoggingMiddleware> logger)  
    {  
        _next = next;  
        _logger = logger;  
    }  

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)  
    {  
        _logger.LogInformation("Handling request: {Method} {Path}",   
            context.Request.Method, context.Request.Path);  

        await _next(context);  // Call next middleware  

        _logger.LogInformation("Finished handling request.");  
    }  
}  

Exception Handling Middleware: ExceptionHandlingMiddleware.cs

public class ExceptionHandlingMiddleware  
{  
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;  
    private readonly ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> _logger;  

    public ExceptionHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> logger)  
    {  
        _next = next;  
        _logger = logger;  
    }  

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)  
    {  
        try  
        {  
            await _next(context);  
        }  
        catch (Exception ex)  
        {  
            _logger.LogError(ex, "Unhandled exception caught.");  
            context.Response.StatusCode = 500;  
            context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";  

            var response = new { message = "An unexpected error occurred." };  
            await context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync(response);  
        }  
    }  
}  

Explanation
RequestLoggingMiddleware logs method and path for every request before and after the request is processed.
ExceptionHandlingMiddleware catches unhandled exceptions, logs the error, and returns a generic JSON error response.
Program.cs wires everything up.

How to Run and Test
Create a new empty ASP.NET Core Web API project (dotnet new web).
Add the two middleware classes.
Replace Program.cs with the sample code.
Run the project.
Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ - should show "Hello World!" and log request.
Navigate to http://localhost:5000/error - triggers exception, logged with JSON error returned.
